/*
    Problem Statement:

    Write a function int productOfSmallestPair(int[] arr) that takes an integer array arr as input and returns the product
    of the two smallest distinct elements in the array.

    Input:
        An integer array arr of size n, where n >= 2.
    Output:
        Return the product of the two smallest distinct elements in arr.

        If the array has fewer than two distinct elements, return -1.

    Function Requirements:
        Your function should first identify the two smallest distinct elements in the array.
        Then, it should compute and return the product of these two elements.

    Example:
    Input:
        arr = [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]
    Output:
        2
    Explanation:
        In the array [5, 2, 8, 1, 9], the two smallest distinct elements are 1 and 2. Their product is 1 * 2 = 2.


    Edge Case Example:
    Input:
        arr = [5, 5, 5]
    Output:
        -1
    Explanation:
        Since there are not enough distinct elements in the array, the function returns -1.
